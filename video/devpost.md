# ðŸ†’ BeCOOLess: Your COâ‚‚-aware shopping list assistant

BeeCOOLess is an app that helps you design shopping lists that fit to your
lifestyle choices. Based on your list and a small extra budget (say 5%) our state of the art algorithm
digs through available offers and recommends a greener option, enabling
you to fight climate change while staying on your budget.

## Our motivation: Small actions amplify
The potential to change the world is inherent to the small choices we take on a
daily basis. Actions, as unnoticeable as the flap of a ðŸ¦‹ butterfly's wings, can
gain incredible power and shape the world. We take the butterfly effect, as a
motivation to identify small, yet effective actions anyone could take to tackle climate change,

## The Problem

According to WHO, a carbon footprint is a measure of the impact your activities have on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2)
produced through the burning of fossil fuels and is expressed as a weight of CO2 emissions produced in tonnes.
The average carbon footprint for a person globally is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in
global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop under 2 tons by 2050. Lowering individual
carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesn't happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, we can start
making a big difference.

Our daily lives heavily influence this emission. Shopping is an activity that almost all humans do which impacts on how
we live. But most of us lack the dedication, and time, to set up a
shopping list which combines all our goals of a healthy, environmentally
friendly, yet affordable diet.

We conducted a small poll and found that 9 out of 10 participants would like to
buy greener products at a small additional cost. **Roughly every second
participant was willing to spend 5% or more for greener products** in the
supermarket.

## The App

It's straightforward.

1. Log in to the app and find your supermarket.

2. Compose your shopping list.

3. Specify the extra budget (say 5%).

4. BeCOOLess will inform you about alternative shopping lists, their cost, and
   their COâ‚‚ savings.

## Business plan

The basic app is free to use. However, you can unlock even more powerful options
to design a shopping list that fits your lifestyle choices for a small monthly
fee, and get rid of the ads, too.
