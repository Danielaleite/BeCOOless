# ðŸ†’ BeCOOLess: Your COâ‚‚-aware shopping list assistant

BeeCOOLess is an app that helps you design shopping lists that fit to your
lifestyle choices. Based on your list and a small extra budget (say 5%) the
software digs through available offers and recommends a greener option, enabling
you to fight climate change while staying on your budget.

## Our motivation: Small actions amplify

The potential to change the world is inherent to the small choices we take on a
daily basis. Actions, as unnoticeable as the flap of a ðŸ¦‹ butterfly's wings, can
gain incredible power and shape the world. We take this famous phenomenon, known
as the butterfly effect, as a motivation to identify small, yet effective
actions anyone could take to tackle climate change,

## The Problem

The math is simple: Fewer carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere means less
global warming. Our daily lives heavily influence this emission. Shopping is a
great example. We all do it, but who has the dedication, and time, to set up a
shopping list which combines all our goals of a healthy, environmentally
friendly, yet affordable diet?

We conducted a small poll and found that 9 out of 10 participants would like to
buy greener products at a small additional cost. **Roughly every second
participant was willing to spend 5% or more for greener products** in the
supermarket.

## The App

It's straightforward.

1. Log in to the app and find your supermarket.

2. Compose your shopping list.

3. Specify the extra budget (say 5%).

4. BeCOOLess will inform you about alternative shopping lists, their cost, and
   their COâ‚‚ savings.

## Business plan

The basic app is free to use. However, you can unlock even more powerful options
to design a shopping list that fits your lifestyle choices for a small monthly
fee, and get rid of the ads, too.
