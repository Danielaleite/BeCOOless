(Philosophical intro)

Have you ever wondered how our lives are affected by the small decisions we
take? We know from the butterfly effect that actions, as unnoticeable as the flap
of a butterfly's wings, can amplify to something that can change the world.

This perspective is particularly helpful to tackle climate change, one of the
key challenges that must be resolved by our and future generations: Even the
smallest actions matter.

(Introduction)

Hello, we are Team L, a group of students from Europe with origins across three
continents. Together we want to find a solution that addresses climate change,
focusing on identifying small actions which are simple to implement once we are
aware of their consequences.

(Data - problem)

Going green is something often associated with great sacrifice or a Bourgeoisie
lifestyle. The math is simple: The fewer CO₂ is released into the atmosphere,
the more we prevent global warming. It is the sheer magnitude of climate
change that seems daunting, even overwhelming, to an individual; how can our daily
choices make any difference to alleviate the problem?

But not all hope is lost! Remember, the smallest actions can amplify to
something great. We intend to enable individuals to bring the battle against
climate change to one’s backyard, one small action at a time.

Human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases – are a primary driver 
of climate change – and present one of the world’s most pressing challenges. This link
between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations – especially CO2 – has been
 true throughout Earth’s history.

According to ( ADD ORG NAME ), carbon dioxide is responsible for ( SOME
STATISTICS ). Shopping contributes to 40% of an individual carbon footprint.

(Storytelling)

Now meet Mike. Mike is a young individual living independently.
Mike likes to live sustainably while living on a budget. Confused with the
plethora of options available, Mike currently buys solely based on the costs.
Here comes BeCOOL. A user-friendly app that allows Mike to choose greener
alternatives while respecting his budget.

calculate the cheapest option available in the market. You then can specify how
much more you are willing to pay to be COOL. Using our state of the art
optimization algorithm, users can see how spending an extra euro on the right
alternative might lead to a tremendous decrease in CO2 emission.

(Business plan)

Freemium: a business model that offers free and premium packages. Basic services are
offered for free, and customers are able to upgrade to premium packages for more services.
