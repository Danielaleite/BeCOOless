(Philosophical intro)

Isn't it astonishing that the potential to change the world is inherent to the
small choices we take on a daily basis? Actions, as unnoticeable as the flap of
a butterfly's wings, can gain incredible power and shape the world.

This famous phenomenon, known as the butterfly effect, may be essential for
 tackling climate change, which undoubtedly will be one of the hardest
 challenges we and future generations will be facing: It is about taking action;
 even the smallest steps can help; and it is our goal to make it easy for
 everyone start walking.

(Introduction)

Hi, we are Team COOL, a group of students from Europe. (Missing bridge, mention
our interests and intrinsic motivation). As a group with members stemming from
three continents and having grown up in societies that could probably not be
more different, we understand that taking action against climate change can be
challenging for many individuals. Not everyone shares our privileges. We intend
to enable individuals to bring the battle against climate change to one’s
backyard, one small action at a time.

(Data - problem)

Going green is often associated with great sacrifice or a Bourgeoisie lifestyle.
Human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases – are a primary
driver of climate change – and present one of the world’s most pressing
challenges. The math is simple: Fewer carbon dioxide released into the
atmosphere means less global warming. Our daily lives influence the emission of
carbon dioxide.

Take shopping as an example. (There should be results from our poll here
suggesting ) Shopping contributes to 40% of an individual carbon footprint.

(Storytelling)

Now meet Mike. Mike is a young individual living independently. Mike likes to
live sustainably while living on a budget. Confused with the plethora of options
available, Mike currently buys solely based on the costs. Here comes BeCOOL. A
user-friendly app that allows Mike to choose greener alternatives while
respecting his budget.

(Platform presentation)

Using the app is very simple. First, you need to input your shopping list. Based
on your preferred supermarket of choice, BeCOOL will calculate the cheapest
option available in the market. You then can specify how much more you are
willing to pay to be COOL. Using our state of the art optimization algorithm,
users can see how spending an extra euro on the right alternative might lead to
a tremendous decrease in CO2 emission.

(Business plan)

are offered for free, and customers are able to upgrade to premium packages for
more services. Advertising, we will publish some free content. Advertisers pay
