(Introduction) Hello, we are Team (name of the team), and together we are trying
to find a solution that addresses climate change by having as reference the
**Sustainable Development Goals**.

(Data - problem) Going green is something often associated with great sacrifice
or a Bourgeoisie lifestyle. Climate change, a problem that affects our planet
Earth sounds like a colossal problem requiring an equally colossal solution to
fix it. According to <ADD ORG NAME>, carbon dioxide is responsible for <SOME
STATISTICS>. We, as team L, intend to enable individuals to bring the battle
against climate change to oneâ€™s backyard, one small action at a time. Shopping
contributes to 40% of an individual carbon footprint.

(Storytelling) Now meet Mike. Mike is a young individual living independently.
Mike likes to live sustainably while living on a budget. Confused with the
plethora of options available, MIke currently buys solely based on the costs.
Here comes BeCOOL. A user-friendly app that allows Mike to choose greener
alternatives while respecting his budget.

(Platform presentation) Using the app is very simple. First, you need to input
your shopping list. Based on your preferred supermarket of choice, BeCOOL will
calculate the cheapest option available in the market. You then can specify how
much more you are willing to pay to be COOL. Using our state of the art
optimization algorithm, users can see how spending an extra euro on the right
alternative might lead to a tremendous decrease in CO2 emission.

(Conclusion)
Our app helps become COOL
