(Philosophical intro)

Climate change will undoubtedly impact everyone. Such a huge problem can only be
solved by many small actions rather than a singular massive one. Just like the flap
of a butterfly's wings, small choices we take on a daily basis gain incredible
power and shape the world.

One of the largest issues with climate change is the steady rise in temperature
caused by greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide. The math is simple: Fewer CO2
released into the atmosphere helps reduce global warming. Data suggests that a 
rise of just 1-3% of global temperature leads to
up to 5% decrease in GDP. That's right, climate change impacts how much you earn,
too.

(Introduction)

We are BeCOOless, and our goal is to empower every citizen to become more carbon
conscious. We are a group of students from Europe determined to help generate
momentum for a greener and brighter future. We come from all parts of the world,
having lived in diverse and multi-cultural environments. As such, we understand
that taking action against climate change can be challenging for many
individuals. Not everyone shares our privileges. We intend to enable everyone
to bring the battle against climate change to oneâ€™s backyard, with actions at a
time.

(Data - problem)

We realized that one common activity around the world is how we shop. Grocery
shopping plays a huge role in our lives. It contributes roughly 40% to an
individual's carbon footprint. What we buy, decides on how we live!

Losing focus on green shopping is a natural consequence of the various options
available. Our survey shows that while over 90% of people are concerned about
climate change, only 48% of people think about carbon emissions while shopping.
Additionally, going green is often associated with great sacrifice or a
Bourgeoisie lifestyle. This is not true! Going green is affordable. It's all about
making minor changes to what we buy and realizing that they can cause huge
differences!

(Storytelling)

This is Mike. He is a young individual who seeks to live sustainably while
staying on a budget. Mike is overwhelmed by the plethora of available options at
the supermarket. How should he choose? Sometimes, he simply buys the cheapest
product, but he would not mind buying a much greener, slightly more expensive
one. This is where BeCOOless comes in. It helps
Mike to choose greener alternatives while respecting his budget.

(Platform presentation)

Using the app is very simple. First, you compose a shopping list. Based
on your preferred supermarket, as well as current and past orders, BeCOOless
knows which items you would usually buy. Using the (threshold) slider, our machine learning
algorithm informs you about greener alternatives that can lead to huge savings
in carbon emissions! In this manner, the app enables you to take the most
impactful decision for spending an extra dollar.

(Business plan)

The BeCOOLess app we've developed, and which you've just seen in action, will be free.
With a premium membership however, you can unlock additional features, like personalized
filters, that empower you to make it a perfect match for your lifestyle.

We understand users who don't want to start using yet another app. That's why our underlying service
also seamlessly integrates with supermarket apps, where it can be used as one-click solution before checkout.

One of our business goals includes partnering up with big supermarkets to offer the service as plugin
in their apps. Our own API is general enough for the service to be installed on other sites,
for instance food blogs and recipe websites, too.

The data we collected is invaluable for our partners to understand their customers, and how to better 
serve their needs for greener products. Product recommendations based on customers' environmental
attitudes complement the existing marketing strategies, but have been largely unexplored so far.

We envision a greener customer-supermarket relationship and our service realizes an important step
towards that goal.

(Conclusion)

Small actions. Large impact. Let's all Be COOL!
