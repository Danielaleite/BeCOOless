(Philosophical intro)

Climate change is a problem that will impact every of the 75 billion tonnes of living matter on this planet.
Such a huge problem can only be solved by many small actions and not by a singular massive action. Just like the flap of
a butterfly's wings, thee small choices wee take on a daily basis can gain incredible power and shape the world.

<<<<<<< HEAD
One of the largest issue in climate change is the steady rise in temperature caused due to greenhouse gases. According
to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), CO2 is responsible for 81% of all green emissions in 2018. The math is
simple: Fewer carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere means less global warming. Data suggests that
a rise of just 1-3% of global temperature leads to upto 5% of loss in GDP. That's right, climate change impacts how much
you earn too!

(Introduction)
Our goal, at Team BeCOOL, is to empower every citizen into becoming more carbon conscious. We are a group of students from
Europe determined to help generate momentum for a greener and brighter future. We come from all parts of the world, having
lived in diverse and multi-cultural environments. We understand that taking action against climate change can be
challenging for many individuals. Not everyone shares our privileges. We intend to enable individuals to bring the battle
against climate change to one’s backyard, one small action at a time.

(Data - problem)

We realized that one activity common around the world is how we shop. Grocery shopping is an activity that plays a huge role
on how we live. Shopping contributes to 40% of an individual carbon footprint. What we buy, decides on how we live!

With so many options available, losing focus on green shopping is natural. Our survey shows that while over 90% of people are
concerned about climate change, only 48% of people think abut the carbon emissions while shopping.
Additionally, going green is often associated with great sacrifice or a Bourgeoisie lifestyle.
This is not true! Going green is affordable, it's a matter of making minor changes to what we buy which makes a huge difference!

=======
This famous phenomenon, known as the butterfly effect, may be essential for
 tackling climate change, which undoubtedly will be one of the hardest
 challenges we and future generations will be facing: It is about taking action;
 even the smallest steps can help; and it is our goal to make it easy for
 everyone to start 'walking'.

(Introduction)

Hi, we are the BeCOOL team, a group of students from Europe whose members have
grown up on three different continents and societies that could hardly be more
different. Hence, we understand that taking action against climate change is a
highly individual and challenging task for individuals. We intend to enable
anyone to fight climate change, one small action at a time.

(Data - problem)

Going green is often associated with great sacrifice or a Bourgeoisie lifestyle.
Human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases – are a primary
driver of climate change. The math is simple: Fewer carbon dioxide released into
the atmosphere means less global warming. Our daily lives heavily influence this
emission.

Take shopping as an example. We all do it, but who has the dedication, and time,
to set up a shopping list which combines all our goals of a healthy,
environmentally friendly, yet affordable diet. In a small poll, we found that 9
out of 10 participants would like to buy greener products at a small additional
cost. roughly every second participant would even be willing to spend 5% or more
in the supermarket for greener products.

(Storytelling)

Now meet Mike. He is a young individual who seeks to live sustainably while
staying on a budget. Mike is overwhelmed by the plethora of available options at
the supermarket. How should he choose? Sometimes, he simply buys the cheapest
option, but he would not mind paying a bit more if he knew the product was much
greener. This is where BeCOOL, the app we've developed, comes in. BeCOOL helps
Mike to choose greener alternatives while respecting his budget.

(Platform presentation)

Using the app is very simple. First, you need to input your shopping list. Based
on your preferred supermarket of choice, current shopping list and past shopping history, BeCOOL will calculate the normal
list of items you will buy in the market. Using the slider, our state of the art optimization algorithm, will show you how
by just choosing greener alternatives of some products can lead to a huge saving in carbon emissions! In this manner,
the app enables you to chose how you spend an extra dollar to make the most impactful decision.
