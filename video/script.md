(Philosophical intro)

Climate change will impact every of the 75 billion tonnes of living matter on
this planet. Such a huge problem can only be solved by many small actions rather
than a singular massive one. Just like the flap of a butterfly's wings, the
small choices we take on a daily basis can gain incredible power and shape the
world.

One of the largest issues with climate change is the steady rise in temperature
caused by greenhouse gases. According to the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), CO₂ caused 81% of all greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. The math is
simple: Fewer carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere helps reduce global
warming. Data suggests that a rise of just 1-3% of global temperature leads to
up to 5% of loss in GDP. That's right, climate change impacts how much you earn,
too!

(Introduction)

Our goal at Team BeCOOless is to empower every citizen to become more carbon
conscious. We are a group of students from Europe determined to help generate
momentum for a greener and brighter future. We come from all parts of the world,
having lived in diverse and multi-cultural environments. As such, we understand
that taking action against climate change can be challenging for many
individuals. Not everyone shares our privileges. We intend to enable individuals
to bring the battle against climate change to one’s backyard, with actions at a
time.

(Data - problem)

We realized that one common activity around the world is how we shop. Grocery
shopping plays a huge role in our lives. It contributes roughly 40% to an
individual's carbon footprint. What we buy, decides on how we live!

Losing focus on green shopping is a natural consequence of the various options
available. Our survey shows that while over 90% of people are concerned about
climate change, only 48% of people think abut carbon emissions while shopping.
Additionally, going green is often associated with great sacrifice or a
Bourgeoisie lifestyle. This is not true! Going green is affordable. It's a about
making minor changes to what we buy and realizing that they can cause huge
differences!

(Storytelling)

This is Mike. He is a young individual who seeks to live sustainably while
staying on a budget. Mike is overwhelmed by the plethora of available options at
the supermarket. How should he choose? Sometimes, he simply buys the cheapest
product, but he would not mind buying a much greener, slightly more expensive
one. This is where BeCOOless, the app we've developed, comes in. BeCOOless helps
Mike to choose greener alternatives while respecting his budget.

(Platform presentation)

Using the app is very simple. First, you need to compose a shopping list. Based
on your preferred supermarket, as well as current and past orders, BeCOOless
knows which items you would usually buy. Using the slider, our machine learning
algorithm, informs you about greener alternatives that can lead to huge savings
in carbon emissions! In this manner, the app enables you to take the most
impactful decision for spending an extra dollar.

(Business plan)

BeCOOless supports local business! By partnering up with chain and local
supermarkets, we are able to obtain the most accurate data for each product's
carbon emission. Additionally, we'll help supermarkets understand their
customers, and how to better serve their needs for greener products. Premium
users will also be able to further customize the recommendation algorithm by
incorporating personal or ethical concerns.

(Conclusion)

Small actions. Large impact. Let's all Be COOL!
